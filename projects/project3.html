            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>For my TIPE in Preparatory Class for Grandes Écoles (2022 - 2024); I had the subject "<em>Sports and games</em>".
                I was already interested in Correction Codes and I often played Takuzus (Sudokus with only 0 and 1). 
                So I naturally thought that with some constraints in data structure, we might actually be able to use the solving of Takuzu as a Correction Code.
                My searched then split into two parts :
                <br>First, create a Takuzu Solver and be able to tell how many data loss I could handle without losing the original data (<em>i.e.</em> the number of cases that we can hide on a solved Takuzu grid while keeping a unique solution).
                <br>Then, determine if we can structure a data sequence of bits as a Takuzu grid.   
                <br><br> A Takuzu grid is a grid composed of 0 and 1 with the following constraints :
                <ul>
                    <li> No more than two identical bits can be adjacent in a row or in a column. </li>
                    <li> Each row and each column must contain an equal number of 0 and 1. </li>
                    <li> No two rows and no two columns can be identical. </li>
                </ul>              
            </p>

        <section class="visual-block">
            <h3>Development</h3>
            <p>The research part concerning the restructuration of a bit sequence I proceeded in 3 steps :
            <ul>
                <li> First count the number of bit composing the data set and enumerate the different decompositions in Takuzus grid possible (a Takuzu grid is an even number squared bits). </li>
                <li> Second, we try to decompose our actual bit sequence in the different Takuzus grid list calculated precedently. </li>
                <li> Third, we check if the decompositions are valid Takuzu grids (respect the 3 constraints listed above). </li>
            </ul>   
            Then if one of them is valid, we can consider that the data sequence can be structured as a Takuzu grid.
            <br>Here's two example of the algorithm with a 2x2 pixels image which is not transformable into Takuzu grids and a one-pixel image which is transformable into Takuzu grids :

                 <img src="../attachments/binairo2.png" alt="Second test of Takuzing images" class="img-big">
            </div>
            <p>The resolution and proof part requires less thinking but takes more time developing. :
            <ul>
                <li> I had to implement each condition verification for rows and columns. </li>
                <li> Then I could make a backtracking algorithm to solve the Takuzu grid. </li>
                <li> In the end, I made an exaustive algorithm that calculate every Takuzu grids of a given dimension, and searched if they were solvable with a given amount of cases deleted.</li>
            </ul>   
            We can determine that from 4 cases deleted in any Takuzu grid, we might lose the unicity of the solution. Determining the exact amount of data loss the "Correction Code" can handle.
            <br> Here are some exemples of resolution and proof results (sadly from bigger than 4x4 Takuzu grids, the exhaustive algorithm crashes due to lack of memory):

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>To conclude, the Takuzu form Correction Code might be very efficient for data transmission with a small amount of data loss. 
                However, the structuration of a data sequence into a Takuzu grid seems very limited. Furthermore in real life, we don't actually know where are the data losses, making this method unusable.
